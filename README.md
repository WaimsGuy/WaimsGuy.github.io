# WaimsGuy.github.io
A portfolio page for myself describing who I am and what I do. This site is made from scratch using raw HTML, CSS, and perhaps eventually some JavaScript.

## A Work In Progress
This site is still a work in progress. While I mainly focus on software development, I still enjoy doing web development stuff on the side. There are still many improvements I can make to this page but updates may be few and far between.

## Why Not Use Frameworks?
Maybe eventually I'll overhaul this portfolio page to use frameworks like react, but honestly I don't see the need for the technical overhead that react carries. This is a simple web page to mainly showcase the projects I've done.
